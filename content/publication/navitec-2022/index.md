abstract: >-
  Uncertainty modeling and bounding are of vital importance for high-integrity
  GNSS applications. Classical approaches are mostly developed in a stochastic
  manner with probabilistic assumptions. However, the exact error distribution
  is often unknown, and remaining systematics may persist, so that a purely
  stochastic modeling of all error sources will not be adequate, and alternative
  uncertainty bounding and propagation should be studied. 

  This paper introduces two deterministic approaches for GNSS uncertainty bounding 
  and compares them with the conventional least-squares method theoretically and 
  experimentally with simulated and real measurements. Both methods use deterministic 
  intervals to denote observation uncertainty, subsequently following a linear 
  uncertainty propagation instead of quadratic one. The interval extension of 
  least-squares transfers the uncertainty into the position domain in the form of 
  zonotope and further bound the stochasticity by the extended point confidence 
  domain. As a comparison, the other method takes advantage of geometrical constraints 
  and convex optimization, leading to a polytopic solution set and zonotopic 
  confidence region. We show their theoretical similarities and highlight different 
  interpretations in practice. Nevertheless, both are sufficient to account for both 
  random and systematic components of uncertainty.
