  For safety critical applications like autonomous driving, high trust in the 
  reported navigation solution is mandatory. This trust can be expressed by the 
  navigation performance parameters, especially integrity. Multipath errors are 
  the most challenging error source in GNSS since only partial correction is 
  possible. In order to ensure high integrity of GNSS-based urban navigation, 
  signal propagation mechanisms and the potential error sources induced by the 
  complex measurement environment should be sufficiently understood. 

In this contribution, we report on recent progress on this topic in our group. 
We conducted various experiments in urban areas and investigated the behavior and 
magnitude of GNSS signal propagation errors. To this end, ray tracing algorithms 
combined with 3D city models are implemented to identify propagation obstructions 
and quantify propagation errors. A Fresnel zone-based criterion is exploited to 
determine the occurrence and magnitude of diffraction. GNSS Feature Maps are 
proposed to visualize the analyses and to predict situations with potential loss 
of integrity. 

To measure the integrity of urban navigation, we developed alternative set-based 
approaches in addition to the classical stochastic approach. Based on interval 
mathematics and geometrical constraints, they are sufficient to bound remaining 
systematic uncertainty and feasible for integrity applications.
