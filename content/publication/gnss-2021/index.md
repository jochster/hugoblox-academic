abstract: >-
  Integrity monitoring is of great importance for Global Navigation
  Satellite Systems (GNSS) applications. Unlike classical approaches based on
  probabilistic assumptions, the alternative interval-based integrity approach
  depends on deterministic interval bounds as inputs. Different from a quadratic
  variance propagation, the interval approach has intrinsically a linear
  uncertainty propagation which is adequate to describe remaining systematic
  uncertainty. In order to properly characterize all ranging error sources and
  determine the improved observation interval bounds, a processing scheme is
  proposed in this contribution.
